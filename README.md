# ConnectFour
training an ai to play connect four


First step was creating the backend of the game

Second step was creating the pygame graphics that the player can interact with

Third step is implementing ai controlled players, with random and minimax algorithms driving their choices

Fourth step will be training an ai (hopefully on the pygame screen rather than numerical inputs) in order to be able to play connect four
